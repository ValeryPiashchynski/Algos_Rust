    // beautiful math here. much easier to explain on board, but itsa kode!
    // on Instruction we have five levels (possible for input n)
    // let i be order no of element.
    // let Ei be element itself. So now E1 = 1, E2 = 3, E3 = 5, E4 = 7 ... E7 = 13 ... E11 = 21 ...
    // let Sn - target sum of n-th level.
    // let (SE)t - sum(Ei, i = 1..t) (sum of our Ei elements where i goes from 1 to t)
    // let Tn - index of the last element on level n. i.e. T3 = 6 (and E6 = 11), T4 = 10 (and E10 = 19)
    // then Sn = (SE)Tn - (SE)T(n-1). It means that target sum is the sum of elements from first to last in n-th level
    //    minus sum of elements from first to last in previous level.
    // now we'll calculate (SE)x for any x.
    // From school math we now sum(i, i = 1 .. n) = n(n+1)/2.
    //    but our x is odd number, so (SE)x = sum(2*i - 1, i = 1 .. x)
    //     = 2*sum(i, i = 1 .. x) - sum(1, i = 1 .. x) = 2 * x (x+1)/2 - x = x^2.
    // in words it means that sum of first x odd numbers is x^2. It's pretty curious on its own and you
    // could check it manually.
    // Now we need to calculate Tn - index of the last element on level n.
    // It's given, that we have 1 element on 1-st level, 2 elements on 2-nd level, 3 elements on 3-d level and so on.
    // It means, that 2-nd level + 1-st level have 2 + 1 elemets, 3-d + 2-nd + 1-st have 3 + 2 + 1 and so on
    // In math it means that n-th level with all previous levels have n*(n+1)/2 elements.
    // so n-th level last element index is just a quantity of all elements on all level, so Tn = n * (n + 1)/2
    //    and T(n-1) = (n - 1) * n / 2
    // We have all the formulas: Sn = (SE)Tn - (SE)T(n-1) = (SE)(n * (n + 1) / 2) - (SE)((n - 1) * n / 2) =
    //     = (n * (n + 1) / 2)^2 - ((n - 1) * n / 2)^2 = ... = n^3
    //
    //    the only thing that upsets me: (i64)^3 maybe much more that resulting i64.
